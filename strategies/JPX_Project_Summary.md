# 📈 JPX Tokyo Stock Exchange Prediction — Project Summary

## 🎯 Objective
Build a **quantitative stock ranking model** using historical Japanese stock market data. The goal is to **rank all eligible stocks daily** by expected return, enabling simulated investment strategies where the top 200 stocks are “bought” and the bottom 200 are “shorted.”

---

## 🗂️ What You'll Be Working With
- 📊 **Historical Stock Prices**: Open, close, high, low, volume  
- 📁 **Fundamentals**: Company-level financials  
- 📈 **Derivatives/Options** data  
- 🧾 **Sample submission files** and a required **time-series submission API**

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts to Understand
- **Quantitative Trading**: Programmatic decision-making based on predictive models  
- **Stock Ranking**: Not just regression — you must output a **rank** for each stock per day  
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Measures risk-adjusted return — used to evaluate your daily long/short portfolio performance  
- **Time-Series Constraints**: Your model **must not peek into the future** — use only past data to predict future rankings

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metric
- Submissions are evaluated by **Sharpe Ratio** of daily spread returns.
- You **rank ~2,000 stocks daily** → Top 200 are considered "long," bottom 200 are "short"
- Stocks are **weighted by rank** (not equal weight), and returns are calculated over 2-day periods
- Only valid **ranks (0 to N-1)** are accepted with **no duplicates**

---

## ⚙️ Submission Method (Python API Required)
You must use the provided Kaggle API loop for prediction. Example:

```python
import jpx_tokyo_market_prediction
env = jpx_tokyo_market_prediction.make_env()
iter_test = env.iter_test()
for (prices, options, financials, trades, secondary_prices, sample_prediction) in iter_test:
    sample_prediction['Rank'] = np.arange(len(sample_prediction))  # Replace with your model logic
    env.predict(sample_prediction)
```

## 📆 Competition Timeline (for context only)
- 🟢 **April 4, 2022** — Competition start  
- 🚫 **July 5, 2022** — Final submission deadline  
- 🏁 **October 7, 2022** — End of forecasting period  
You’re working post-deadline, so it’s for **learning, not submitting**.

## 🧰 What You’ll Be Doing

1. **Load and Explore the Data (EDA)**  
   Understand stock patterns, missing values, and relationships.

2. **Engineer Features**  
   Moving averages, volatility, momentum, lag features, etc.

3. **Build Prediction Model**  
   Start with models like **LightGBM/XGBoost**, then explore **neural nets**.

4. **Rank Stocks**  
   Output a daily **ranking (0 to N-1)** for all active stocks.

5. **Simulate Portfolio Performance**  
   Optionally recreate the Sharpe Ratio calculation to test your model offline.

6. **Make it a Portfolio Project**  
   Add visualizations, model insights (SHAP), and wrap in a clean GitHub repo.

## 🚫 What You Cannot Do
- Publish the **raw data** (due to Kaggle rules)
- Use future data in feature engineering (time leakage)
